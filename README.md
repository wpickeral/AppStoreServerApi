# AppleStoreServerApi.Net

A .Net 8.0 library to decode and verify Apple server to server in app purchase notification and request [App Store Server API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreserverapi).

This library is already working but work is still in progress. Don't hesitate to contribute if you see any possible improvment or fixes.

I mainly based my work on this node library: https://github.com/agisboye/app-store-server-api

## Features
- History, subscription status and order lookup endpoints
- Typed responses (i.e. you get auto-complete for the fields in the response)
- Manages authentication tokens for you
- Helpers to decode JWS items
- Performs certificate validation against Apple's CA.
- Types and helpers for [App Store Server Notifications V2](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreservernotifications)

## Usage
### Prerequisites
To get started, you must obtain the following:
- An [API key](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreserverapi/creating_api_keys_to_use_with_the_app_store_server_api)
- The ID of the key
- Your [issuer ID](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreserverapi/generating_tokens_for_api_requests)

A note on the issuer ID:
Apple's documentation currently has incorrect instructions on how to obtain this.
To get your issuer ID, you must [create an API key for App Store Connect](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/creating_api_keys_for_app_store_connect_api) (not the App Store Server API). Only after creating your first API key will the issuer ID appear.

### Create a client
```csharp
var PRIVATE_KEY = @"-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
MHcCAQEEIPWH5lyoG7Wbzv71ntF6jNvFwwJLKYmPWN/KBD4qJfMcoAoGCCqGSM49
AwEHoUQDQgAEMOlUa/hmyAPU/RUBds6xzDO8QNrTFhFwzm8E4wxDnSAx8R9WOMnD
cVGdtnbLFIdLk8g4S7oAfV/gGILKuc+Vqw==
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----";

var KEY_ID = "ABCD123456";
var ISSUER_ID = "91fa5999-7b54-4363-a2a8-265363fa6cbe";
var APP_BUNDLE_ID = "com.yourcompany.app";

var client = new AppleAppstoreClient(
  PRIVATE_KEY, KEY_ID, ISSUER_ID, APP_BUNDLE_ID, environment: AppleEnvironment.Production
);
```
